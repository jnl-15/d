        <div class="section letter">
            <p>Deareast, Derick,</p>
            <p>You've been like sunlight through a cracked window—unexpected, warm, impossible to ignore. You didn't barge in or demand to be noticed; you simply arrived, and somehow the hallway felt different. Sometimes I catch myself tracing the edges of your presence, like I'm memorizing the shape of something I didn't know I was missing, something I didn't even realize I had been quietly hoping for.</p>
            <p>I'm usually fearless. I speak when I have the chance to, I move with certainty, I don’t make myself small.  But around you… something softens. The words stumble. My thoughts race ahead, rehearsed and ready, but my lips stay behind, unsure if they're allowed to follow. So I carry these small conversations meant only for you, tucked safely in my mind, replaying them when no one is watching. </p>
            <p>At PakiTAMgilas, I remember choosing my words carefully—”Congrats, Derick.” Just enough. Polite. Appropriate. We were not that close, and I respected that distance. Still, there was a part of me that wanted to linger a little longer than that moment allowed. I wanted to ask about the songs that loop endlessly in your head, the color that you've liked since childhood, the food that feels like home after a long day. I wanted to understand the world as you see it. </p>
            <p>Sometimes your name drifts through my thoughts like a quiet refrain I didn't mean to memorize. Sometimes I find myself defending you silently, even when no one asked me to, even when it doesn't matter. Sometimes my eyes brighten before I can stop them, simply because you're nearby—because your presence has become something my heart recognizes before my mind does. </p>
            <p>I don't know what will come of this, or where it could possibly lead. I don't know if this is meant to grow, or simply exist as something gentle and true for a season. But I do know I can't keep walking past your light without noticing it—without letting it reach me, even just a little. If you remember the last poem I wrote that was posted on The Junior Advocate page, “Still, It Grew,” I want to be honest: you were in my thoughts while I was writing it. Not literally, not as a story about us—but because the title itself speaks to my reason, I never expected to like someone again after a long season of choosing myself. </p>
            <p>I pray for you—often. For your safety, for your dreams, for your loved ones, even on days when I don't say your name out loud. I may not be able to complete the Misa de Gallo, but I still believe in alignment, in timing, in the possibility that the stars notice things we're afraid to say. I don't want this to remain unspoken forever. If I'm given the chance, I won't hide it. I'll let the world know that I felt something real.</p>
            <p>I may not be the woman in your dreams, the one you imagined before I sent you those reviewers back then. But I can be someone determined, someone sincere, someone who would choose you without hesitation, but with intention. I won't push or demand space in your life. I just want you to know that I'm here—open, honest, and willing. For you.</p>
            <p>
            <p>Always,<br>J</p>
